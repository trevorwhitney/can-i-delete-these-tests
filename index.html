                    1. They were tautological, and now they were failing

                    But I didn't, because I the units of codes they were testing still existed, and I was
                    taught not to delete tests unless you delete the corresponding code.

                    modeled] as a Turing tape, and what the program can do is somehow related to the
                    number of bits on that tape…If you want to thoroughly test that program, you need...
                    another Turing tape of at least the same number of bits."</q>

            <section>
                <p>A thoroughly tested application will have more lines ot test than of code, which means:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="fragment">More time was spent writing tests.</li>
                    <li class="fragment">There are likely to be more bugs in the the tests than the code.</li>
                    <li class="fragment">An incorrect test that incorrectly validates a bug is as, if not more likely,
                        than the lack of a test that misses a bug.
                    </li>

                <aside class="notes">
                    The last one is bad, because since test are documentation, it's not always clear if the app was
                    supposed to work that way. The first one may be good however, since the testing phase is the design
                    phase.

                    Fowler on the Service layer: In web applications this would correspond to testing through an API
                    layer while the top UI part of the pyramid would correspond to tests using something like Selenium.

            <section>
                <p>When unit testing, you should test the inputs and outputs of the unit of code under test,
                    mocking out and spying on collaborators to make sure they receive the correct information.</p>

                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    This is why I learned when I first started here, but isn't this tightly coupling your
                    test to the APIs of external collaborators, instead of testing behaviour?

            <section>
                <p>There should not be a single line of code in your app that was not driven out by a specific
                    test.</p>
                <aside class="notes" data-markdown>
                    I also learned this, but at first didn't always understand that an acceptance test might cover a
                    lot of lines, since it won't work without them.

                    become a lot cheaper

                <p>Having expensive UI tests that test the behaviour of an application is CPU bound.</p>

            <section>
                <p>If we think of the service layer as being interchangeable with integration (not acceptance/ui) tests,
